# CyberAudit AI

Overview
CyberAudit AI is an AI-driven solution that simplifies the analysis of unstructured cybersecurity audit reports. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the project provides real-time, chat-based insights to decision-makers, enhancing their ability to respond to cybersecurity risks effectively.



 Project Description
CyberAudit AI interprets and summarizes complex cybersecurity audit reports, enabling users to quickly extract actionable insights. The solution allows for dynamic, real-time interactions where decision-makers can ask specific questions and receive clear responses based on the AI's analysis.

 In-Scope
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities
- Machine Learning algorithms for pattern recognition
- Chat-based interaction for real-time insights
- Customizable insights based on user needs

 Out-of-Scope
- Manual report generation
- Technical remediation implementation
- Highly specialized industry contexts

technologies Used
NLP, Flask, Python, Machine Learning, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, OpenAI GPT, REST APIs, Pandas, NLTK
 Features
- Analyze unstructured audit reports
- Real-time chat-based interactions
- Identify vulnerabilities and risks
- Provide actionable insights for decision-making

Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cyberaudit-ai
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
